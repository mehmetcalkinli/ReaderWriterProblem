This project implements a semaphore-based solution to the Readers-Writers Problem, ensuring controlled access to shared variables. Readers can access data simultaneously, while writers require exclusive access to maintain consistency. By using semaphores, the solution prevents race conditions and optimizes performance.

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of multithreading, synchronization, and concurrent programming, key concepts in operating systems.
